# Code of Conduct

LF2X follows the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/) Code of Conduct. By participating, you agree to uphold this code.

## Our Pledge
We pledge to make LF2X a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Demonstrating empathy toward others
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy toward users and contributors

Unacceptable behaviours include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without consent
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behaviour. Maintainers may take appropriate corrective action in response to unacceptable behaviour.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported to the maintainers. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Enforcement Guidelines
Maintainers will follow the four-step enforcement ladder outlined in the Contributor Covenant (correction, warning, temporary ban, permanent ban).

## Attribution
This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/.
