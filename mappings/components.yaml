# LangFlow component mapping registry (base runtime support)
#
# Each entry maps a LangFlow node type to metadata used during conversion.
# Fields:
#   type: canonical LangFlow type identifier (string)
#   supported: bool flag indicating whether LF2X fully supports this component
#   target: preferred runtime when supported (langchain|langgraph)
#   notes: optional guidance for partial/unsupported components
#
# This registry is intentionally minimal and should evolve as coverage grows.

- type: ChatInput
  supported: true
  target: langchain
  notes: "Linear input node recommended for LCEL workflows."

- type: ChatOutput
  supported: true
  target: langchain
  notes: "Standard output sink; compatible with LangChain and LangGraph."

- type: Agent
  supported: true
  target: langgraph
  notes: "Agent nodes usually indicate branching logic; prefer LangGraph."

- type: AgentQL
  supported: partly
  target: langgraph
  notes: "Requires custom tool wrapper; emit TODO for manual integration."

- type: TavilySearchComponent
  supported: partly
  target: langgraph
  notes: "External tool; generate stub and flag follow-up in conversion report."
